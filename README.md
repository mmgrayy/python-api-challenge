# python-api-challenge
#Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

WeatherPy
In the first part of this challenge we created  a Python script in order to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
#Tasks
Created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Ran linear regression to analyze the following relationships:
Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

#VacationPy
In second half of this project I worked with the weather data to plan future vacations. I used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.
#Tasks
Narrowed down weather conditions to find 'Ideal Vacation Weather':
- A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
-Wind speed less than 10 mph.
-Zero cloudiness
Found hotels in the areas that met these ideal conditions
